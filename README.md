# [Project 1 - Abusive Language Detection](https://github.com/dpowell022/Capstone_2)
### Improve user engagement on your social platform by detecting abusive language in text!
Used TF-IDF vectorization and a 135,000-row labeled Twitter dataset to train a random forest model to perform supervised classification of whether a tweet is ‘abusive’ or not with a 92% Recall score. 
 - Python tools:  NLP, Random Forest, TF-IDF vectorization, Seaborn, Sci-kit Learn, Supervised Classification


# [Project 2 - Helpdesk Ticket Auto-Categorization](https://github.com/dpowell022/Capstone_3)
### Reduce human error and improve data accuracy by letting machine learning categorize your helpdesk ticket for you!
Used SVM and multi-class classification to take inputs sourced from helpdesk ticket data and automatically categorize the nature of the issue from a list of over 50 categories, automating an otherwise manual (and often inaccurate) task.
 - Python tools: Support Vector Machines, NLP, n-gram work vectorization, Pandas, k-NN, Multi-class Classification.
