# Project 1 - Abusive Language Detection
### Improve user engagement on your social platform by detecting abusive language in text!
Used TF-IDF vectorization and a 135,000-row labeled Twitter dataset to train a random forest model to perform supervised classification of whether a tweet is ‘abusive’ or not with a 92% Recall score. 

# Project 2 - Helpdesk Ticket Auto-Categorization
### Reduce human error and improve data accuracy by letting machine learning categorize your helpdesk ticket for you!
Used SVM and multi-class classification to take inputs sourced from helpdesk ticket data and automatically categorize the nature of the issue from a list of over 50 categories, automating an otherwise manual (and often inaccurate) task.
