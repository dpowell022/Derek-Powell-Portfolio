# [Project 1 - Abusive Language Detection](https://github.com/dpowell022/Capstone_2)
### Improve user engagement on your social platform by detecting abusive language in text!
Used TF-IDF vectorization and a 135,000-row labeled Twitter dataset to train a random forest model to perform supervised classification of whether a tweet is ‘abusive’ or not with a 92% Recall score.

 - Python tools:  NLP, Random Forest, TF-IDF vectorization, Seaborn, Sci-kit Learn, GridSearchCV, Supervised Classification

# [Project 2 - Helpdesk Ticket Auto-Categorization](https://github.com/dpowell022/Capstone_3)
### Reduce human error and improve data accuracy by letting machine learning categorize your helpdesk ticket for you!
Used SVM and multi-class classification to take inputs sourced from helpdesk ticket data and automatically categorize the nature of the issue from a list of over 50 categories, automating an otherwise manual (and often inaccurate) task.
 - Python tools: Support Vector Machines, NLP, n-gram work vectorization, Pandas, k-NN, RandomSearchCV, Multi-class Classification.

# [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/derek.powell/viz/ChemicorpDashboard_16581921872730/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
Explored a practice data set to answer questions about segmentations and revenue opportunity, such as 
 - "Which of our customers spends the most, and on what products?" and 
 - "From which customer segment / product would we get the most value from further investment?"

# [Project 3 - Predicting User Adoption](https://github.com/dpowell022/26.2.3-Relax-Inc-Take-Home-Challenge/blob/main/relax%20inc%20takehome%20challenge.ipynb)
### Identifying the factors that influence user adoption is pivotal towards growing your business!
In this mock take-home challenge, my goal was to define and then isolate 'adopted users' from a dataset of users subscribing to a product and then determine which variables seemed to have the most positive correlation with the user adoption rate. 
 - Python tools: Time series analysis, Heatmap correlation, Seaborn

# [Project 4 - Improving User Engagement](https://github.com/dpowell022/26.2.2-Ultimate-Tech-Take-Home-Challenge/blob/main/Ultimate%20Tech%20Take-Home%20Challenge.ipynb)
### Running A/B Experiments to identify best-value marketing campaigns can drive user engagement!
In this mock take-home challenge, my goal was formulate an A/B experiment (and a success metric to measure on) which would show the effectiveness of a chosen marketing campaign in driving increased user engagement.
- Python tools: Time series analysis, Heatmap correlation, RandomForest supervised learning, Seaborn visualizations
