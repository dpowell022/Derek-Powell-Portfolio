My recent data science projects

---
# [Project 1 - Abusive Language Detection](https://github.com/dpowell022/Capstone_2)
### Improve user engagement on your social platform by detecting abusive language in text!
Used TF-IDF vectorization and a 135,000-row labeled Twitter dataset to train a random forest model to perform supervised classification of whether a tweet is ‘abusive’ or not with a 92% Recall score. 

 - Python tools:  **NLP**, Random Forest, TF-IDF vectorization, Seaborn, **Sci-kit Learn**, **GridSearchCV**, Supervised Classification

# [Project 2 - Helpdesk Ticket Auto-Categorization](https://github.com/dpowell022/Capstone_3)
### Reduce human error and improve data accuracy by letting machine learning categorize your helpdesk ticket for you!
Used SVM and multi-class classification to take inputs sourced from helpdesk ticket data and automatically categorize the nature of the issue from a list of over 50 categories, automating an otherwise manual (and often inaccurate) task.

 - Python tools: **Support Vector Machines**, NLP, **n-gram** word vectorization, Pandas, k-NN, **RandomSearchCV**, Multi-class Classification.

# [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/derek.powell/viz/ChemicorpDashboard_16581921872730/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
Explored a practice data set to answer questions about segmentations and revenue opportunity, such as 
 - "Which of our customers spends the most, and on what products?" and 
 - "From which customer segment / product would we get the most value from further investment?"

# [Project 3 - Predicting User Adoption](https://github.com/dpowell022/predicting-user-adoption)
### Identifying the factors that influence user adoption is pivotal towards growing your business!
In this project, my goal was to define and then isolate 'adopted users' from a dataset of users subscribing to a product and then determine which variables seemed to have the most positive correlation with the user adoption rate. 

 - Python tools: **Time series analysis**, Heatmap correlation, Seaborn, **OneHot Encoding**

# [Project 4 - Improving User Engagement](https://github.com/dpowell022/improving-user-engagement)
### Running A/B Experiments to identify best-value marketing campaigns can drive user engagement!
In this project, my goal was formulate an A/B experiment (and a success metric to measure on) which would show the effectiveness of a chosen marketing campaign in driving increased user engagement.

 - Python tools: **Time series analysis**, Heatmap correlation, **RandomForest** supervised learning, Seaborn visualizations
